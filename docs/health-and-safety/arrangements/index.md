# Arrangements

Hanworth Villa FC is committed to ensuring that clear and practical arrangements are in place to manage health and safety effectively.

Each arrangement below sets out the steps we take to meet our Health and Safety Policy aims.  
They are simple, actionable, and designed to help all volunteers, coaches, and officials understand what to do.

Arrangements should be reviewed at least once per season, or sooner if there are changes or incidents.  
If you have any questions or concerns about any arrangement, please contact the Safety Officer
